    "[importance/potential effect of voter ID law]\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirty-five of the fifty states of the U.S. have passed stricter voter ID laws that require or request voters to present a form of identification at the polls. \n",
    "The remaining fifteen states do not require voters to present any documentation to vote at the polls. States such as Indiana, Wisconsin, and Tennessee have strict photo ID laws for voters, while states such as Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania have no requirements for voter identification. A visualization of the levels of strictness of voter photo identification laws for each state can be seen in https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id#undefined. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Voter ID Laws](voteridmap.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of implementing stricter voter identification requirements include preventing voter impersonation, thus  increasing public confidence in election processes. Disadvantages of implementing stricter laws unnecessarily burdens voters and administrators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "In this project we focus our investigations of voter identification laws on the state of Indiana, which implemented a strict voter identification law in 2008. We seek to analyze how much voter turnout would have decreased or increased without the implentation of the law. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Project Goals\n",
    "> - Apply the matching method on pre- voter identification law features.\n",
    "> - Conduct k-Nearest-Neighbors (k-NN) classification to make predictions on voter data and cross validation to evaluate.\n",
    "> - Strengthen our pyspark data analysis skills, collaborative skills, and project organization skills\n",
