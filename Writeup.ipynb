    "[importance/potential effect of voter ID law]\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirty-five of the fifty states of the U.S. have passed stricter voter ID laws that require or request voters to present a form of identification at the polls. \n",
    "The remaining fifteen states do not require voters to present any documentation to vote at the polls. States such as Indiana, Wisconsin, and Tennessee have strict photo ID laws for voters, while states such as Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania have no requirements for voter identification. A visualization of the levels of strictness of voter photo identification laws for each state can be seen in the map in **Fig. 1** below.\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of implementing stricter voter identification requirements include preventing voter impersonation, thus  increasing public confidence in election processes. Disadvantages of implementing stricter laws unnecessarily burdens voters and administrators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "In this project we focus our investigations of voter identification laws on the state of Indiana, which implemented a strict voter identification law in 2008. We seek to analyze how much voter turnout would have decreased or increased without the implentation of the law. \n",

    "> - P = predicted T\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare the voter data with and without the implementation of a voter identification law, we observe that the difference in means $E[Y|T=1]-E[Y|T=0]$ is [...]. Thus, the treated voters (with implementation of a voter identification law) have a [...] compared to non-treated voters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The propensity score is the conditional probability of receiving the treatment, the implementation of the voter identification law. Using this score means that we do not have to achieve conditional independence $(Y_1,Y_0) \\perp |X$. In other words, we do not have to condition on the whole $X$ to achieve independence of potential outcomes of the treatment. Instead, it is sufficient to control confounders $X$ for a propensity score $P(x)=P(T|X)=E[T|X]$ to achieve $(Y_1,Y_0) \\perp |P(x)$.\n",

    "The propensity score essentially converts $X$ into the treatment $T$, acting as a middleman between $X$ and $T$. Initially, we cannot compare treated and non-treated osbervations. However, we can compare a treated and a non-treated observation if they have the same probability of receiving the treatment since receiving or not receiving the treatment would be attributed to randomness. Thus, we hold the propensity score constant to make the data appear more random.\n",

    "We simplify our propensity score weighting estimator to $E[Y\\frac{T-P(x)}{P(x)(1-P(x)}]$, where $P(x)$ and $(1-P(x))$ both must be greater than $0$.
